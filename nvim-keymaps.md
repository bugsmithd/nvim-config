## Quick Tips

**Replace a word across the file:**
Place cursor on word → `<leader>S` → modify replacement → `<Enter>`

**Paste without losing clipboard:**
Yank what you want → visual select target → `<leader>P`

**Swap two words:**
Yank first word (`yiw`) → cursor on second word → `siw` (substitute.nvim)

**Select to first char forward:**
`f{char}` to jump, or `t{char}` to stop before it. Use `v` first for visual.

**Search tip:**
`<leader>fs` for content search, `<leader>ff` for filename search.
Inside Telescope: `<C-p>` toggles preview if you need context.
